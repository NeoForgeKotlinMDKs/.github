This organization contains **unofficial** forks of [NeoForge's MDKs](https://github.com/NeoForgeMDKs) that are configured to use Kotlin and [Kotlin for Forge](https://github.com/thedarkcolour/KotlinForForge).

The MDKs here are template repos and mirros of the branches on [this repository](https://github.com/Erdragh/Neoforge-Kotlin-MDK). Pull Requests and Issues should be filed against that repository.

The logo of this organization is an adaption of NeoForge's logo, which is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with the Kotlin Logo layered behind it.
